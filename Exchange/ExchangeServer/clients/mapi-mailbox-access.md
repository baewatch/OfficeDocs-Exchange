# Enable or disable MAPI access to mailboxes in Exchange Server

MAPI is a client protocol that lets users access their mailbox by using Outlook or other MAPI email clients. By default, MAPI access to a user mailbox is enabled. Disabling MAPI access to a mailbox prevents the user from using Outlook to access their mailbox in Exchange mode. It doesn't prevent the user from using Outlook on the web or Outlook using other protocols (for example, POP3, IMAP4, or Exchange ActiveSync) to access their mailbox.

Administrators can use the Exchange admin center (EAC) or the Exchange Management Shell to enable or disable MAPI access to user mailbox.

For additional management tasks related to user access to mailboxes, see these topics:

- [Enable or disable Outlook on the web access to mailboxes in Exchange Server](outlook-on-the-web/mailbox-access.md)

- [Enable or disable Exchange ActiveSync access to mailboxes in Exchange Server](exchange-activesync/activesync-mailbox-access.md)

- [Enable or disable POP3 or IMAP4 access to mailboxes in Exchange Server](pop3-and-imap4/configure-mailbox-access.md)

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete: 5 minutes.

- For more information about accessing and using the EAC, see [Exchange admin center in Exchange Server](../architecture/client-access/exchange-admin-center.md).

- To learn how to open the Exchange Management Shell in your on-premises Exchange organization, see [Open the Exchange Management Shell](/powershell/exchange/open-the-exchange-management-shell).

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Client Access user settings" entry in the [Clients and mobile devices permissions](../permissions/feature-permissions/client-and-mobile-device-permissions.md) topic.

## Enable or disable MAPI access to a single mailbox

### Use the EAC to Enable or disable MAPI access to a single mailbox

1. In the EAC, go to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**.

2. In the list of mailboxes, find the mailbox that you want to modify. You can:

   - Scroll through the list of mailboxes.

   - Click **Search** ![Search icon](../media/ITPro_EAC_.png) and enter part of the user's name, email address, or alias.

   - Click **More options** ![More Options icon](../media/ITPro_EAC_MoreOptionsIcon.png) \> **Advanced search** to find the mailbox.

     Once you've found the mailbox that you want to modify, select it, and then click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.png).

3. On the mailbox properties page that opens, click **Mailbox features**.

4. In the **Email Connectivity** section, configure one of these settings:

   - If you see **MAPI: Enabled**, click **Disable** to disable it, and then click **Yes** in the warning message that appears.

   - If you see **MAPI: Disabled**, click **Enable** to enable it.

     ![Protocol access settings for a mailbox in the EAC at Recipients \> select mailbox \> Edit \> Mailbox features \> Email connectivity](../media/8c2d9cda-aa53-4b6e-b83a-0f55b4b3fd3d.png)

     When you're finished, click **Save**.

### Use the Exchange Management Shell to enable or disable MAPI access to a mailbox

To enable or disable MAPI access to a single mailbox, use this syntax:

```powershell
Set-CasMailbox -Identity <MailboxIdentity> -MAPIEnabled <$true | $false>
```

This example disables MAPI access to the mailbox named Ken Sanchez.

```powershell
Set-CasMailbox -Identity "Ken Sanchez" -MAPIEnabled $false
```

This example enables MAPI access to the mailbox named Esther Valle.

```powershell
Set-CasMailbox -Identity "Esther Valle" -MAPIEnabled $true
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-CASMailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/set-casmailbox).

## Enable or disable MAPI access to multiple mailboxes

### Use the EAC to enable or disable MAPI access to multiple mailboxes

1. In the EAC, go to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**.

2. In the list of mailboxes, find the mailboxes that you want to modify. You can:

   - Scroll through the list of mailboxes.

   - Click **Search** ![Search icon](../media/ITPro_EAC_.png) and enter part of the user's name, email address, or alias.

   - Click **More options** ![More Options icon](../media/ITPro_EAC_MoreOptionsIcon.png) \> **Advanced search** to find the mailbox.

3. In the list of mailboxes, select multiple mailboxes of the same type (for example, **User**) from the list. For example:

   - Select a mailbox, hold down the Shift key, and select another mailbox that's farther down in the list.

   - Hold down the CTRL key as you select each mailbox.

   After you select multiple mailboxes of the same type, the title of the details pane changes to **Bulk Edit**.

4. In the details pane, scroll down to **MAPI**, click **Enable** or **Disable**, and then click **OK** in the warning message that appears.

   ![Bulk select mailboxes in the EAC to enable or disable MAPI](../media/4bd368a0-cd9e-4eb7-97b6-001cad02bc2d.png)

### Use the Exchange Management Shell to enable or disable MAPI access to multiple mailboxes

You can use the **Get-Mailbox**, **Get-User** or **Get-Content** cmdlets to identify the mailboxes that you want to modify. For example:

- Use the _OrganizationalUnit_ parameter to filter the mailboxes by organizational unit (OU).

- Use the _Filter_ parameter to create OPATH filters that identify the mailboxes. For more information, see [Filterable Properties for the -Filter Parameter](/powershell/exchange/filter-properties).

- Use a text file to specify the mailboxes. The text file contains one mailbox (email address, name, or other unique identifier) on each line like this:

  > ebrunner@tailspintoys.com <br/> fapodaca@tailspintoys.com <br/> glaureano@tailspintoys.com <br/> hrim@tailspintoys.com

This example disables MAPI access to all user mailboxes in the North America\Finance OU.

```powershell
$NAFinance = Get-Mailbox -OrganizationalUnit "OU=Marketing,OU=North America,DC=contoso,DC=com" -Filter "RecipientTypeDetails -eq 'UserMailbox'" -ResultSize Unlimited; $NAFinance | foreach {Set-CasMailbox $_.Identity -MAPIEnabled $false}
```

This example disables MAPI access to all user mailboxes in the Engineering department in Washington state.

```powershell
Get-User -Filter "RecipientType -eq 'UserMailbox' -and Department -like 'Engineering*' -and StateOrProvince -eq 'WA'" | Set-CasMailbox -MAPIEnabled $false
```

This example uses the text file C:\My Documents\Accounts.txt to disable MAPI access to the specified mailboxes.

```powershell
Get-Content "C:\My Documents\Accounts.txt" | foreach {Set-CasMailbox $_ -MAPIEnabled $false}
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-Mailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/get-mailbox) and [Get-User](/powershell/module/exchange/get-user).

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you've successfully enabled or disabled MAPI access to a mailbox, do any of these steps:

- In the EAC, go to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes** \> select the mailbox \> click **Edit** ![Edit icon](../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.png) \> **Mailbox features** and verify the **MAPI** value in the **Email Connectivity** section.

  ![Protocol access settings for a mailbox in the EAC at Recipients \> select mailbox \> Edit \> Mailbox features \> Email connectivity](../media/8c2d9cda-aa53-4b6e-b83a-0f55b4b3fd3d.png)

- In the Exchange Management Shell, replace _\<MailboxIdentity\>_ with the identity of the mailbox (for example, name, alias, or email address), and run this command:

  ```powershell
  Get-CasMailbox -Identity "<MailboxIdentity>"
  ```

- Use the same filter that you used to identify the mailboxes, but use the **Get-CasMailbox** cmdlet instead of **Set-CasMailbox**. For example:

  ```powershell
  Get-User -Filter "RecipientType -eq 'UserMailbox' -and Department -like 'Engineering*' -and StateOrProvince -eq 'WA'" | Get-CasMailbox
  ```

- In the Exchange Management Shell, run this command to show all mailboxes where Outlook on the web access is disabled:

  ```powershell
  Get-CasMailbox -ResultSize unlimited -Filter "MAPIEnabled -eq `$false"
  ```
